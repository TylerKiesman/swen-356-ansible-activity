# swen-356-ansible-activity
This is for an activity I created for a software engineering course where my team had to teach Ansible. One file is an example Ansible playbook which just writes to a file and prints 'hello world'. The other is the solution to a challenge the students had where they needed to clone a GitHub repository using Ansible.
